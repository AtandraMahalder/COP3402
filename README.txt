To run the program, we need a unix environment. To compile open the terminal and enter the command "gcc driver.c lex.c"
This will generate an executable file "a.out"
To execute the program use ./a.out [inputfile],
where the [inputfile] is a file that contains source program written in PL/0,
which needs to be tokenized.
