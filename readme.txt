The given project implements a virtual machine which is known as a P-machine.
To run the Project, please compile the file vm.c on a linux terminal with the command: gcc vm.c
This will generate an executable file named "a.out".
Now to execute the program, type the command: ./a.out [inputfile]
Here [inputfile] is the name of the file to be given as input to the VM. Without it, we will run onto a segmentation
fault.
